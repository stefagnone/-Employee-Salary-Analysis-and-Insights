# -Employee-Salary-Analysis-and-Insights

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis on a dataset representing anonymized employee data to identify factors influencing salary. This blind analysis, conducted for an auditing client, required inferring data labels, understanding industry implications, and predicting salary determinants.

The analysis focused on:
- Renaming columns based on inferred data meanings.
- Conducting descriptive, correlation, and regression analyses to understand salary impact factors.
- Providing actionable recommendations for salary policy improvement.

This project showcases skills in statistical analysis, data interpretation, and executive reporting for real-world business insights.


## Technologies Used
- **SPSS**: Statistical analysis and regression modeling
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, organization, and descriptive statistics
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: Presentation and executive summary visualization

## Key Insights
- **Gender Pay Gap**: Women earn approximately $2,000 less than men, underlining a gender disparity in salary policy.
